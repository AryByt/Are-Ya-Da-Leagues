        Soccer is a game played by two teams with 11 players each on a field
        with a goal for each team. It’s the most popular team sport on the
        planet, a fast-paced game with few breaks and one simple aim — to score
        a goal. On some continents, the game’s called football; on others, it’s
        called soccer. Other names for the sport include footy, fitba, fútbol,
        calcio, futebol, voetbol, le foot, foci, sakka, and bong da. Everywhere,
        however, soccer, as it’s known in the USA, is called the beautiful game.
