## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I know how my MVP's are going to work, and what informations i want to display. And with the help of the recordings I will be able to get the MVP's done. 

### Weaknesses: 
Putting everything togheter and being able to do display everything how i have in mind.Should have also invested more time into planing everything out.

### Opportunities:
just a better understading of state and setState and routes. Soccer is something that I'm passionate about so i want to be able to make this as usefull and interactive as i can.
### Threats:
Being able to debug, and keep on track. Also being able to reach out when I need help instead of going down a rabbit hole and trying to figure somethign out for hours.
